# Making

## Technologies

This site was created using [Canopy IIIF](https://canopy-iiif.github.io/docs/about), an open-source static site generator designed for fast creation, contextualization, and customization of a discovery-focused digital scholarship and collections website using IIIF APIs.  See the [Create a Canopy Project guide](https://canopy-iiif.github.io/docs/get-started) for detailed step-by-step instructions to create your own site.

Maps were created using [ArcGIS](https://www.arcgis.com/index.html).

3D images were created using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and [SketchFab](https://sketchfab.com/feed).

## Site Maintenance

Northwestern Libraries will support this site through December 31, 2029. After that date, text and site information will be stored in [ARCH](https://arch.library.northwestern.edu/), Northwestern’s institutional repository. The Lydia Luhman Pederson collection has a long-term [digital](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/collections/a2d334d8-8ea7-4dca-a65a-25509b76283c) and [physical](https://search.library.northwestern.edu/permalink/01NWU_INST/h04e76/alma9980757755902441) home with Northwestern Libraries.
