# The Cape to Cairo Route, White Tourism, and Souvenirs From 1950s Africa
This digital exhibit explores what we can learn from the items collected during a journey. In 1953, Lydia Luhman Pederson, a white woman from Rockford, Illinois, went to Africa for two months. Years later, her film footage, scrapbook of pictures and receipts, and an assortment of souvenirs were donated to the Herskovits Library at Northwestern University. Looking through these items offers us a glimpse of the history of tourism and of Africa as seen through Lydia's eyes.

  <td>Seeing the items Lydia collected made us curious about the creators of these objects. We chose a small selection of items to examine in detail and asked contemporary scholars of African studies to write essays reflecting on their significance. These are paired with 3D images, so that you can take a close look at the objects from all angles. We also include other objects with their photographs and short descriptions. The items were chosen to be representative of the variety of items Lydia collected and places she visited. We invite you to consider why certain items become valued as souvenirs.</td>

In some locations, Lydia filmed and wrote narrative scripts to describe what she saw. The films are currently available only to [Northwestern affiliates](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/items/f1fa2fd4-0d23-4939-bd2e-eaacecc24e72), but we have included excerpts from some of her scripts. </td>

  <td>Part of looking closely at an archive involves noticing what is absent. Lydia collected decorative and useful items, but we know almost nothing about the creators of these items. As a nod to these unknown creators, we explore the works of contemporary artists from the countries Lydia visited. </td>
