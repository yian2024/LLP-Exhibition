This drawing from the film addresses the “procession of the dispossessed,” a theme that has recurred in Kentridge’s work for several decades.The film, made in 1989 while apartheid was still underway, follows two central characters named Soho Eckstein and Felix Teitelbaum, in the process exploring South African history. Viewers watch Soho amass wealth and power by exploiting Black workers; his counterpart, Felilx, is an artist, forming the alter ego to Soho with a greater emphasis on his anxiety and vulnerability.

The smudging of charcoal alternately highlights and shades the contours of the boy’s face. His flat expression and exaggerated features, however, reveal a vision of Africans that aligns more with Lydia’s characterization as primitive, dark, and foreign. That Lydia made this the first page of her scrapbook sets the tone for the remainder, in which Black Africans are largely treated as objects of ethnographic curiosity.

The chevron and diamond patterns, the competing graphic elements, had the color choice all spoke to certain rites of passage. Mahlangu speaks to the significance of this work within the community: “When you get married, you paint your first house.
