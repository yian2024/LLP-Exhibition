Throughout the second half of the twentieth century, Moké used his art to reveal the tenor of life in Kinshasa, documenting its noisy intersections, lively nightlife, and youthful escapades. From his arrival in Kinshasa in the early 1960s to his death in 2001, the city’s population grew from approximately 500,000 to over 6 million. As he witnessed the explosion of the city, Moké assiduously tracked and seemingly reveled in its lively urbanity. Art historians Okwui Enwezor and Chika Okeke-Agulu described Moké as such:  \\\"A veritable visual journalist, Moké has an eye for the pictorial thrill of mundane experience, of the urban folk, or the spectacular performance of official pageantry” (33).\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"Moké was one of many influential practitioners who contributed to the establishment of “Popular Painting” as a defining genre of Congolese art. Alongside others like Chéri Samba, these artists celebrated the joyful common moments of urbanity in figurative paintings. Moké went on to mentor famed Congolese artist Chéri Samba, whose work similarly focuses on life in the DRC but with a more explicit focus on the political. Unlike emerging art practices in other Central African countries, the popular painters of Kinshasa engaged in a symbiotic relationship with social and political events while remaining grounded in a local, collective visual style. Though his work is less explicitly political than others, Moké’s practice itself engages in a subtle political engagement and critique in its frank assessment of popular life in the dramatic and tumultuous decades after the end of colonial rule. With the rise of Mobutu, who renamed the country Zaire in 1971, the country became a one-party totalitarian state that would come to be plagued by various problems as the century wore on, until the DRC was reestablished as a presidential republic in 1997. Moké’s vivacious and often humours artistic practice extended through this time of extreme political upheaval and colors his work though he did not explicitly engage in political statements.\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"The painting Kinshasa at Noon (1980) emblematizes Moké’s practice as an energetic evocation of postcolonial life in an emerging metropolis. Every inch of the canvas is packed with cars and trucks attempting to traverse the highway, buildings that enclose the scene, and figures who sit and drink Fanta, buy groceries to carry home, engage in conversation on the street, and attempt to move about the hectic city. Though it is fictitious, the bold colors and robust figures lend to the image a sense of vivacity that contributes to Moké’s reputation as a documentarian. One truck is labeled “Atelier d’Art Liyolo” and packed with men who are being shepherded to the studio of sculptor Alfred Liyolo, who trained scores of Congolese artists in his workshop and at the Art Academy of Kinshasa.

The industry had brought great prosperity to Lubumbashi but was abandoned in the post-colonial era when Baloji was born.

The figures are ghostly and seem to haunt the landscape that they now inhabit. In Untitled 17, we are confronted with such a ghost - a shirtless man in black-and-white stares direclty out of the picture plane. The metal scaffolding of Baloji’s own photograph lead the eye directly to his face. A few other small figures populate the background, roaming through the industrial wastes for any valuable vestige left behind. The landscape is barren and does little to represent the prosperity that Katanga once enjoyed. Baloji seems to ask: the mines were successful during the colonial era, but at what cost and to what end? The nameless central figure’s labor has led to what we see now.
