Shawky’s play with the past is rooted in fantasy, fiction, and wonder, as he stages performances and films that subtly excavate the bases of the stories that countries and continents tell themselves to form an identity, a belief system, and then a history.

The films recount the story of the Crusades, a series of military expeditions between 1095 and 1291 led by the Catholic Church into the Holy Land to wrest Jerusalem from Islamic rule. Reframing the Crusades through an Arab lens, Shawky sheds light on the problematic nature of Euro-centric historiography that privileges one version of the past over another.

Led by Colonel Ahmed Urabi, the revolt sought to overthrow the ruler Tewfik Pasha and eradicate foreign influence over the country, but it ended in failure with the institution of British colonial rule throughout Egypt, which endured until 1956. The actors purposefully mimic marionettes, harkening back to his Cabaret Crusades, while the story recalls the 2011 revolution in Egypt and the subsequent military coup.

The tapestries, however, include only four women. The fifth is understood to be the artist, whose women’s work is unpictured but present in the objects’ material being. Later works feature looser threads, chaotic lines, and painted marks to create visual landscapes evoking the complexity of womanhood. The splattered paint across her later works like Red Diagonals (2000) references the history of Abstract Expressionism, a movement associated with mid-century masculinity.

Art historian Chika Okeke-Agulu has argued that her focus on the undressed female body, autoeroticism, and homosexuality derives from and is a response to these early experiences in Egypt.
